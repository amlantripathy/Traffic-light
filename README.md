# Traffic-light
1.At first I had declared all the pins that would be giving the
output.
/* In the setup section.
2.Again using an array I had initialized that the pins are used
as output pins.
/*In the loop section.
3.At first I have given output for green signal in the north
direction and red signal in all other direction.
And have used delay for 10 seconds..
Then I had switched on the yellow signal in north and east
direction for 8 seconds using delay… and had switched off
the green signal in north direction and red one in east
direction…
After this I had switched off the yellow signal in north and
east direction.
4.After the yellow signal has been switched off the green has
been switched on in the next direction and red one in the
previous direction.(The same step (step 3) is repeated in
the further execution changing only with the next
consecutive direction)…
